This repository contains code that is extracted from this repository:
`https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Data-Science-and-Python-Machine-Learning`

## training data set

`PastHires.csv` contains the training dataset

## Program

`NewHireDecisionMaker` is the Machine Learning (ML) using Apache Spark ML library (MLlib).
Main activities are:

- create NewHireDecisionMaker object
- load training data
- make a model
- create a test data
- make a prediction on test data
- print the result.

## Preparation to run

- Start up Hadoop cluster
- Copy `PastHires.csv` file into HDFS


## Run the program

```bash

./NewHireDecisionMaker.py
```
